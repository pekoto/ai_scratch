## Generative AI Courses: Where to Start?

Not sure where to start with generative AI?

Here's a list of courses I've found around the web.

When picking a course, ask yourself the following:

* How much time do I have?
* Do I want to become somebody who builds foundational models (if so, a foundational course will be best), or develop on top of existing models ("AI engineer")
* Is there a particular niche you want to focus on? e.g. marketing, graphics, text scraping/summarization. If so, you may be better Googling for those areas.
* Do you want to learn a particular framework in use at your company. For example, PyTorth or Jax.
